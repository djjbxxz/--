# Fall detection based on pose estimation
By estimating pose in real-time videos using **[Openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)**, falls can be recognized by analyzing the acceleration and duration of certain poses.

## Save record

Falls deteced will be documented, and can be reviewed by clicking the records on down-right window.

On the up-right side of the window, there is a search box that can be used to seach falls across the fall records database by specifying the location and the time of falls.

Bacause fall detection is based on 2D images (no depth), some falls might be hard to identify at a single angle.
